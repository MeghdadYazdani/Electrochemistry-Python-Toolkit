# Electrochemistry Python Toolkit üß™‚ö°

Welcome to the **Electrochemistry Python Toolkit**! This repository provides a foundational Python framework for electrochemical research, simulations, and data analysis. Whether you're working on battery modeling, fuel cells, corrosion studies, or electroanalytical techniques, this toolkit is designed to help you get started.

In addition to traditional electrochemistry, this repository integrates **machine learning** and **data science** tools to analyze electrochemical data, predict material properties, and optimize experimental parameters. The goal is to bridge the gap between electrochemistry and modern computational techniques.
