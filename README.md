# Electrochemistry Python Toolkit üß™‚ö°

Welcome to the Electrochemistry Python Toolkit! This repository provides a foundational Python framework for electrochemical research, simulations, and data analysis. Whether you're working on battery modeling, fuel cells, corrosion studies, or electroanalytical techniques, this toolkit is designed to help you get started.

The repository also integrates machine learning and data science tools to analyze electrochemical data, predict material properties, and optimize experimental parameters. By combining traditional electrochemistry with modern computational techniques, this project aims to bridge the gap between theory and data-driven insights.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

Base Python Code: Scripts for electrochemical simulations, data processing, and visualization.

Machine Learning: Tools for applying ML models to predict battery life, material performance, and reaction kinetics.

Data Science Utilities: Functions for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing electrochemical data (e.g., CV, EIS).

Open-Source: Publicly available for collaboration, contributions, and reuse.

### Topics Covered üìö
